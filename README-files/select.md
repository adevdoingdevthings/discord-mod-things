<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78881422?v=4" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Aliucord icon"> [**Aliucord**](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord) (Android)
*   **Pros:** Very stable, fastest way to use discord (even with over 100 plugins), lots of plugins that never break, new features from newer versions of Discord added into the last good version of Discord.
*   **Cons:** Stale community, nothing new being added (only bug fixes).

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112445065?v=4" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Vendetta icon"> [**Vendetta**](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/Vendetta) (iOS, Android)
*   **Pros:** Got a lot of developers to make plugins & themes (I'd guess around 40% still work on modern Discord).
*   **Cons:** Dead, majority of developers left the community and are not updating their things after it died.

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101209876?v=4" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Enmity icon"> [**Enmity**](https://github.com/enmity-mod/enmity) (iOS)
*   **Pros:** Has support for Vendetta AND Enmity plugins, uses the same theme system as Vendetta (all themes work on all Vendetta-based loaders).
*   **Cons:** Dead, nearly every developer left the iOS modding community other than ~6 people after Enmity died.

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163481464?v=4" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Bunny icon"> [**Bunny**](https://github.com/bunny-mod/Bunny) (iOS, Android)
*   **Pros:** Continued & modernized Vendetta, a huge amount of code was changed.
*   **Cons:** Dead, a lot more developers left the community after it died. iOS maintainer snuck unwanted code into BunnyTweak, which caused BoundTweak to fork it and remove it.

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133474989?v=4" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Unbound icon"> [**Unbound**](https://github.com/unbound-app/client) (iOS, Stale Android)
*   **Pros:** Nice code, potential to be something great.
*   **Cons:** Years of development for only a theme system, not very usable. Very little amount of developers, with nobody maintaining the Android version.

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159218871?v=4" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Revenge icon"> [**Revenge**](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-bundle) (Android, Dead iOS)
*   **Pros:** Bunny, but it works on modern Discord, has a "clear js bundle" button in developer settings.
*   **Cons:** Literally leeching off of Bunny (only code differences makes it a whole lot slower and adds 1 button), next version is uncertain if it will survive (very little community and developers are concerning since it will be incompatible with vendetta-based mod plugins), next version isn't independent (relies on Unbound Hermes compiler), code is unnecessarily complicated, Revenge Next is a rewrite of Revenge Rewrite, for some reason.

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159218871?v=4" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Revenge icon"> [**Revenge Next**](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-bundle-next) (Android)
*   **Pros:** Stupidly fast (faster than modern Discord in my testing), powerful plugins.
*   **Cons:** (See Revenge's general cons regarding its future and reliance).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudySnowX/BoundTweak/refs/heads/main/assets/logo/icon.png" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Boundtweak icon"> [**Boundtweak**](https://github.com/CloudySnowX/BoundTweak) (iOS)
*   **Pros:** Only somewhat modern Discord mod for iOS, no malicious code unlike upstream's previous versions.
*   **Cons:** Only maintainer isn't a developer (almost no code was changed other than names), doesn't use its own bundle (uses Revenge's), owner doesn't know how to use Git very well or is just being lazy (like me, in this very repo).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C0C0B01/KettuManager/1220/Images/kettu_logo.png" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Kettu icon"> [**Kettu**](https://github.com/C0C0B01/Kettu) (Android)
*   **Pros:** Being developed much better than Revenge, faster than Revenge, smart with their fork (optimized, less crashes and bugs).
*   **Cons:** Absolutely horrible development, looks like owner doesn't even know how to use Git too well or is just lazy, like BoundTweak except for Android and the maintainer is an actual developer.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C0C0B01/KettuManager/1220/Images/kettu_logo.png" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Lumi icon"> [**Lumi**](https://github.com/C0C0B01/Lumi) (Android)
*   **Pros:** Stupidly modern (potentially *too* modern?), absolute best support for plugins and themes (since they are first-party), fast. Powerful plugins. Best possible mod if this is something you want.
*   **Cons:** Community focused (barely usable for any developers since third-party anything is basically nonexistent), Small amount of plugins and themes with an even smaller community than Revenge Next (doubt much will be supported), not at all what I want out of a Discord mod.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluemods/Bluecord/refs/heads/master/patch/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/logo.png" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Bluecord icon"> **~~Bluecord~~ *literal-remote-access-trojan*cord** (Android)
*   **Pros:** It's an old version of Discord (same version as Aliucord).
*   **Cons:** Literal remote access trojan, Aliucord can do everything it can do, and more without hacking you, proprietary (technically open core), [absolutely horrible owner](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/1Y2m2lMSpN3GlOcXyceaO88Ljnr8xuNcp), claims to be open source but in reality the source code isn't everything and README.md gaslights users into believing people who say bluecord is malicious are lying ["for their own benefit"](https://github.com/bluemods/Bluecord/blob/master/README.md) [(archived version incase README changes and git history is dropped)](https://web.archive.org/web/20250414141539/https://github.com/bluemods/Bluecord/blob/master/README.md) even though there is no benefit. Now, let's just pretend Bluecord is safe and I am lying to you to keep Bluecord to myself, Aliucord is still open source, and does everything Bluecord does but better. I have no reason to lie about this.

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1965106?v=4" width="20px" height="20px" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="General icon"> **All of the above (General)**
*   **Pros:** You can make Discord into your perfect chat app.
*   **Cons:** No single place for documentation (you need to look at multiple sites, ask people who know, look at other people's code, and probably still not understand anything; it's a nightmare).
