# üí° My Discord Things
This repository is the home to all of my plugins and themes for these mods:
- [Revenge](https://github.com/revenge-mod)
  - [BoundTweak](https://github.com/CloudySnowX/BoundTweak)
  - [Kettu](https://github.com/C0C0B01/Kettu)
- [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord)

Though, in the future I might add stuff for:
- [Lumi](https://github.com/C0C0B01/Lumi)
- [Unbound](https://github.com/unbound-app/client)
- [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord)
  - [Equicord](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord)

Since this is a **very** unprofessional repository, I don't rebase, do any testing, and just simply push to main. There will be a lot of commit noise.

My stuff is only tested on two devices, my Pixel 8 running [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/), and my iPhone 8+ with [palera1n](https://palera.in/). Issues may happen with other devices, and I won't fix it if it's too annoying.

## üé® Themes
### Revenge, BoundTweak, Kettu, Lumi
> [!WARNING]
> I stopped working on [LHM Theme](#lhm-theme-again---theme-link---no-preview) as it would have just become [Darkened Amethyst](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purple-EyeZ/Darkened-Collection/refs/heads/main/minified_themes/Darkened_Amethyst_min.json) but worse, and I've been using [YouGray](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dora727/doraa-pyoncordstuff/refs/heads/master/Themes/YouGray/YouGray.json) since it matches my Material You colours. I have no reason to work on a theme I won't even use.
##### *[LHM Theme (Again)](https://github.com/adevdoingdevthings/revenge-things/blob/main/LHM.json) - [Theme Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adevdoingdevthings/revenge-things/refs/heads/main/LHM.json) - No Preview*
<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>A theme with only 4 colours changed. This was meant to become a rewrite of the old LHM theme that broke on TabsV2, along with upstream. Upstream wasn't too different anyways, just slightly less contrast.</p>
</details>

### Aliucord
##### *[Material 3 Grey](https://github.com/adevdoingdevthings/discord-mod-things/blob/main/Material%203%20Gray.json) - [Theme Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adevdoingdevthings/discord-mod-things/refs/heads/main/Material%203%20Gray.json) - No Preview*

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>An attempt to get my Material You colours over to Aliucord, colour codes taken from my own OS and YouGray. Pull requests are very welcome here since I barely did any testing.</p>
</details>

### Unbound
> [!NOTE]
> Coming [soon‚Ñ¢](http://soon.urbanup.com/10937957)

## üñãÔ∏è Fonts
### Revenge, BoundTweak, Kettu
##### *[Quicksand + Whitney](https://github.com/adevdoingdevthings/revenge-things/blob/main/font.json) - [Font Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adevdoingdevthings/revenge-things/refs/heads/main/font.json) - [Preview](https://github.com/adevdoingdevthings/discord-mod-things/blob/main/README-files/quicksandwhitney.png)*

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  <p>A font with Quicksand as the base font, and Whitney as the italics since Quicksand doesn't support italic fonts. I also just like Whitney.</p>
</details>

## üîå Plugins
### Revenge (Next)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Waiting for [Revenge Next](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-bundle-next) to have a stable release on Android, and either for [BoundTweak](https://github.com/CloudySnowX/BoundTweak) to work well enough with Revenge Next, or drop support for it.
### Kettu, (Current) Revenge
> [!NOTE]
> Waiting to see if [Kettu](https://github.com/C0C0B01/Kettu) will go EOL soon-ish or not before writing plugins for [Vendetta](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/Vendetta)-based mods. Honestly, I don't have much hope considering [my lazy commits](https://github.com/adevdoingdevthings/discord-mod-things/commits/main/) are named better than [the owner's commits](https://github.com/C0C0B01/Kettu/commits/main/?author=C0C0B01). But, let's just wait and see.
### Unbound
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I will only learn how to write plugins for [Unbound](https://github.com/unbound-app) if [BoundTweak](https://github.com/CloudySnowX/BoundTweak) goes EOL, and there isn't any other iOS alternatives.
### Aliucord
> [!NOTE]
> I am not sure if I will write plugins for [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord) since it uses either Java or Kotlin, both I found horrible to learn for me and never ended up doing it.
