# ðŸ’¡ My Revenge/Aliucord Things
This is a repository for me to test things for [Revenge](https://github.com/revenge-mod) and [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord).
Since this is a **very** unprofessional repository, I don't rebase, do any testing, and just simply push to main. There will be a lot of commit noise.

## ðŸŽ¨ Themes
### Revenge
* [LHM Theme (Again)](https://github.com/adevdoingdevthings/revenge-things/blob/main/LHM.json)
[Theme Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adevdoingdevthings/revenge-things/refs/heads/main/LHM.json) | No screenshot avaliable
> [!WARNING]
> I have stopped all development on this theme due to not using it myself, along with this, there are only 2 colours changed iirc.
### Aliucord
* Coming soon... _pretty soon_.

## ðŸ”Œ Plugins
* Waiting for [Revenge Next](https://github.com/revenge-mod/revenge-bundle-next) to be stable on Android, and either for [BoundTweak](https://github.com/CloudySnowX/BoundTweak) to also be stable with Revenge Next, or for [Unbound](https://github.com/unbound-app) to be our only option on iOS.
